# Years of fun as remote manager of remote workers
Ten years ago I joined Red Hat working on a very internal technical subsystem of our middleware application server, as a full-remote associate. My family and my friends thought I was crazy switching to work from home. One hundred percent of my time. Mum told me "So isolated? You will turn mad!". Well, ten years later I'm still a 100% remote worker, with the role of Manager of Software Engineers of a distributed team with associates working from their home, all over the world. Open-source culture, open organization principles, and the right mindset permitted me not only to survive to full remote work but also to have a lot of fun both as an individual contributor and manager.

Don't get me wrong, has not been always easy. Full remote working, and even more remote management, require a complete change of mindset. And I can bear witness changing mindset is one of the biggest challenges you can face in adulthood.
Let me start with a real story. I had joined Red Hat for more than one year and my team planned an in-person face-to-face meeting in Bejing. I was excited when I boarded on China Airlines airplane, it was the first time for me in China and also the first time I would have seen my colleagues in person.
You know, it’s a long journey from Italy to Bejing and in the middle the night I felt very thirsty. I really needed some fresh water. I asked the flight attendant for a glass of water and she kindly brought me one quickly. 
I drank, but I was puzzled, I would say shocked because the water was hot. Hotter than the one I normally use to make a cup of tea. The flight attendant explained to me that is perfectly normal to serve hot water, because of the traditional Chinese medicine, and she also gently tried to persuade me to don't have fresh water, at all. I finally, got my glass of fresh water, but I realized at that very moment I cannot build my relationship with colleagues relying on everything I think I know, relying on my cultural assumptions. I cannot, because our background cultures are so different: we grown up in so many different parts of the world with various believes and values. What is "normal" for me, maybe it's not for any of them and vice versa.
So what when you realize and accept you don't have a common background with your colleagues? 

You can see from two different perspectives:

* On one hand, the value of diversity. Diversity could bring different views, ideas, spotting different problems and their solving paths. I'm a lucky leader, having people from 7 different countries, 3 continents. And 40% of them are women. So I know what diversity is. Don’t sacrifice this diversity to reach consensus quicker, the consequence could be what is called groupthink, an hastily agreed decision stopping the innovation. Associates should be encouraged on bringing their own perspectives and background to conversations because multiple views always favor innovation. Respecting and appreciating diversity, not only make the organization more competitive, but also give associates the personal enrichment coming from colorful relationships.

* On the other hand, diversity and multi-cultural background could be barriers to communicating and collaborating. Before you can work together, you must be able to share ideas. With so heterogeneous cultures, you risk innovation is lost-in-translation. A common set of values and a common background culture are important, especially when you are already missing non-verbal communication and in-person contact. You need something to rely on, something that could be considered "normal", despite different backgrounds.
That is the organization’s culture
An organization’s culture is the glue keeping the team anchored to common values. It makes everyone feel safer sharing the same values, same goals, same bold statements.

Trusting each other is easier when you share values, aspirations, and what you believe. Our associates sincerely believe our open-source culture could really change the world. Sharing values, beliefs, and hopes we share the vision of the world we want.
And what is the role of a leader or manager in this?
A challenging one: catalyze this change from the fragmentation of cultures, communication style, and experiences to a kaleidoscope of different cultures contributing to the organization’s one
You need, as a leader, to step back a little from what and how people are doing, avoiding micro-management. 
Show trust in your team, championing the organization’s culture, and sharing values with your teammate will help a lot building mutual trust.

The leader has to create a context where associates feel listen and appreciated and where they can find all the whys behind the organization’s strategy and goals.
Embracing the open organization’s culture will make associates feeling part of a community that really cares about them and their ideas.
The leader should actively participate in the organization’s culture growth and adoption, making associates feel it is the glue I mentioned before.
Leading a full-remote team means also you cannot rely on 3 important facilitators: time spent together, symbols and rituals. 
You will miss the time together in front of the coffee machine, informal happy hours, formal dinners.

Dressing code, office location, even the game area for the more geek companies are all symbols you cannot count on.
You will miss all the rituals an office life has, starting from the commute which helps on switching yourself in "working mode".
So what? Should you try to mime the in-office experience in a fully-remote environment?
Do you want virtual coffee break online-meeting, virtual happy hours online-meeting, and even virtual commute online-meeting? 
Did you hear about online-meeting fatigue, right? Well, my 10 years old remote team has never suffered from online-meeting fatigue but it hasn’t ever pretended to do the same things an in-office-based team does.  

Maybe some of them work well for some team, and whatever works for your team is great and you should keep it going, but don't try to force them too much. In my experience, full-remote workers could perceive them as an invasion of their work-life balance. And believe me, we hate this kind of invasion, because it's not easy to get to this balance working fully remotely and we became over-protective of whatever we reached and sounds reasonable for us.
In fact, leading a full-remote team means changing the way you are catalyzing the organization’s culture adoption and love.
You have to change your focus from spending time together to the values and bold goals you share, creating also new symbols and rituals suitable for the virtual environment. 

What worked for me and the team I’ve been part of in the last 10 years? 
Basically, everyone in the team, both leaders and single contributors keep always in mind open organization principles and focus on a few critical stuff:

1. Show passion. Passion is contagious. Passion for what you do, passion for the values, and open-source culture. Show virtual symbols of your passion: a nice email signature recalling organization’s culture, a profile picture where you proudly wear your red fedora.
2. Be open. Open to new ideas, open to new contributors, open to all opinions. Being truly open is harder than it could seem. You are really open when you are able to take open decisions: transparent, inclusive, and considering your colleagues, contributor, clients, and anyone impacted by the decision as your customer.
3. Be transparent and adapt. Provide to anyone in the team as much context as possible to understand the whys and the strategy of the organization. Then ask and listen. Give and receive feedback as a gift. Use the feedback to adapt the context putting everyone in the position for expressing all his or her potential.  
4. Show Trust. Avoid micro-management and rely on shared values and open culture as the common base to build trustful relationships. Think about the team as a community, an open-source community of enthusiast people. The leader can’t have the know-how to make all decisions and innovate, but his or her role is to delegate to the right people and show them trust.
5. Be inclusive. We need to be intentional about inclusion in a virtual environment where we cannot just nudge colleagues, or getting involved in a quick chat during a coffee break. 
But being intentional moves inclusion on a deeper, level. In a full-remote environment, you will never feel the inclusion just happen, but you will feel that someone really cares about you and your ideas to intentionally include you in a team, discussion or project.
Create rituals favoring inclusions. Regular weekly call for each project with open agenda and open discussion, regular retrospective after each milestones to share feedback, a virtual book club with regular meetings.You need rituals: whatever you select use a regular reliable schedule. Regarding contents: try, ask for feedback refine and repeat.
6. Create connections don't just connect.  
Indeed, to work successfully in virtual environments, we have to pay special attention to the humans on the other side of the screen. We don't just need to "be connected", but we need to create connection between humans. 
One to One video meetings are important to create a relationship between remote associates: be consistent and reliable with their schedule, make them a ritual.
Not only video meeting, also asynchronous media (like emails or chats) could create a connection: The key is to actively listen to the person behind the media, whichever the media would be.
7. Take care of associates and adapt. 
Empower your associates giving them the freedom and the flexibility to do their best, promote the courage to innovate and impacting on the organization’s success. 
Support them in creating their networks and develop their careers. 
Listen. Listen to their needs, even their rants. 
Adapt their roles, their careers, their tasks to their aspirations: create the context where they can feel empowered and they love their jobs. 

After more than 10 years, I can affirm that I survived in a fully remote environment, and I also had a lot of fun.
My takeaways from these 10 years? Avoid pretending to mime an in-person experience in the virtual world and keep in mind open-source culture, open organization principles, and open management practice.
In short: Be open and enjoy diversity through the open-source culture. Wherever your distributed team, your community, is dispersed.
